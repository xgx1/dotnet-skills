# Investigating Evaluation Results

> **⚠️ Skill evaluations now run on the Vally harness.** As of the Vally migration, the LLM eval pipeline (`evaluation.yml`) no longer uses `skill-validator evaluate`; it runs Vally via `eng/vally-adapter/` and uploads `vally-results-*` artifacts. For investigating current eval failures, use the guide at `eng/vally-adapter/InvestigatingResults.md` in the repository root instead. This document describes the legacy `skill-validator evaluate` schema and is retained for historical results and reference. (The `skill-validator check` **linter** is unaffected and still runs via `skill-check.yml`.)

This guide is intended primarily for AI agents investigating skill evaluation failures, though humans will find it useful too. It documents the `results.json` schema, common failure patterns, and recommended fixes.

## Using this guide with an AI agent

This document is designed to be read by AI coding agents. When a skill evaluation has failures, the PR comment includes a ready-to-use prompt — just copy and paste it to your AI agent. The agent will download the artifacts, read this guide, analyze the results, and suggest fixes.

If you need to run the investigation manually, follow the [Quick start](#quick-start) below.

## Quick start

1. **Download the results artifact:** `gh run download <run-id> --repo dotnet/skills --pattern "skill-validator-results-*" --dir <path>`
2. **Read `summary.md` first** for a quick overview of which scenarios passed/failed
3. **Read `results.json`** for the full metrics, agent output, assertions, and judge reasoning
4. **Identify the failure pattern** using the categories below — most failures match multiple patterns; fix them in priority order (timeouts first, then activation, then quality/rubric issues)
5. **Apply the fix** and re-run with `/evaluate`

## Finding the artifacts

### Via CLI (recommended for AI agents)

Extract the workflow run ID from the **Full results** link in the PR eval comment (e.g., `https://github.com/dotnet/skills/actions/runs/23520818616` → `23520818616`), then:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> --repo dotnet/skills --pattern "skill-validator-results-*" --dir ./eval-results
```

This downloads all result artifacts into subdirectories, each containing `results.json` and `summary.md`.

> **Note:** The `--pattern` flag is important — without it, `gh` will attempt to download all workflow artifacts including non-zip files (e.g., `.tar.gz`), which causes an extraction error and a non-zero exit code even though the eval results download successfully.

### Via browser

From the PR comment, click the **Full results** link to open the GitHub Actions workflow run. Then:

1. Click on any job (e.g., `evaluate (technology-selection)`)
2. Expand the **Upload results** step
3. Find the `Artifact download URL` in the log output
4. Download and extract

Alternatively, scroll to the bottom of the workflow run summary page and download from the **Artifacts** section.

## Understanding `results.json`

Each file contains a top-level object with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `schemaOwner` | `skill-validator`. This distinguishes the retired evaluator output from Vally adapter results |
| `schemaVersion` | Legacy skill-validator results schema version. The first explicit version is `1`; older unversioned files remain readable |
| `model` | Model used for agent runs |
| `judgeModel` | Model used for judging |
| `timestamp` | When the results were written (UTC) |
| `verdicts[]` | Array of per-skill results |

### Verdict structure

Each verdict contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `schemaOwner` / `schemaVersion` | The same legacy schema identity, repeated so standalone `verdict.json` files are self-describing |
| `skillName` | Name of the skill being evaluated |
| `passed` | Overall pass/fail |
| `scenarios[]` | Array of per-scenario comparisons |
| `overfittingResult` | Overfitting analysis (if enabled) |

### Scenario structure

Each scenario includes two required runs (baseline + isolated). It may also include an optional plugin run, and their comparison:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `scenarioName` | Human-readable scenario name |
| `baseline` | Run without the skill |
| `skilledIsolated` | Run with only this skill loaded |
| `skilledPlugin` | Optional run with the full plugin loaded (may be null when plugin runs are disabled) |
| `timedOut` | Whether any run hit the timeout |
| `isolatedImprovementScore` | Weighted improvement (isolated vs baseline) |
| `pluginImprovementScore` | Weighted improvement (plugin vs baseline); optional and only computed when a plugin run is present |
| `isolatedBreakdown` | Per-metric contribution to the score (see below) |
| `pluginBreakdown` | Per-metric contribution to the score (see below); optional and only populated when a plugin run is present |
| `pairwiseResult` | Judge's rubric-by-rubric comparison |
| `perRunScores` | Per-run improvement scores as a flat array of numbers (one per run); when a plugin run is present, each value is `min(isolated, plugin)` for that run; when no plugin run is present (`skilledPlugin` is null), each value is the isolated improvement score for that run |

> **Note:** Scenarios do not have a `passed` field. To determine pass/fail for an individual scenario, check whether `improvementScore >= 0`. This is the effective score: when no plugin run is present it equals `isolatedImprovementScore`; when a plugin run is present it is the min of isolated and plugin scores. The `passed` field exists only at the verdict level (per-skill).

> **Reused baselines:** When the run was invoked with `--baseline-from`, the `baseline` arm is not executed — its `metrics` and `judgeResult` come from the shared baseline file produced earlier with `--baseline-out` (computed once, honoring `--runs`). Such scenarios are reported with the `baseline-reused` session phase and a `reused` baseline status. The baseline file is keyed on `--model` and `--judge-model` plus, per scenario, a SHA-256 of the prompt and a composite SHA-256 over its setup inputs (copied test files, explicit setup files, and setup commands) and its evaluation criteria (rubric, assertions, expect/reject tools, and turn/token/timeout limits); reuse fails fast if the agent model, judge model, or any prompt-plus-setup-plus-criteria identity is missing, so the baseline you compare against is always identity-matched and a shared prompt across cases with different fixtures or rubrics cannot cross-contaminate. Because the baseline output is identical across every skill/agent that consumes the same file, this acts as a shared control group and removes baseline run-to-run variance from cross-skill comparisons.

> **Decoupled runs and judging:** `evaluate --no-judge` runs the agent arms and persists `sessions.db` but performs no judging and needs no baseline file, so baseline and treatment arms can run in one parallel pool. Each persisted session row carries a `baseline_key` column — the same prompt-SHA-plus-target-SHA identity used for baseline reuse. A later `rejudge <treatment-dir> --baseline-dir <baseline-dir>` pairs each treatment run with its baseline run by that key (preferring the matching run index), runs the same judges and gates an inline `evaluate` would, and writes baseline judge/pairwise results back to the baseline `sessions.db` and treatment judge results to the treatment `sessions.db`. Baseline and treatment must share `--model`; the judge model resolves to `--judge-model`, else the treatment DB's persisted judge model, else the baseline DB's, and a mismatch between the two persisted judge models (without an explicit override) is rejected.

### Breakdown fields

The `isolatedBreakdown` and `pluginBreakdown` objects show how each metric contributed to the improvement score. Each field is a raw delta (not yet weighted). The final score is computed as a weighted sum:

| Field | Weight | Range | Meaning |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| `qualityImprovement` | 0.40 | [-1, 1] | Rubric-based quality delta |
| `overallJudgmentImprovement` | 0.30 | [-1, 1] | Holistic judge assessment delta |
| `taskCompletionImprovement` | 0.15 | {-1, 0, 1} | Did assertions pass? |
| `tokenReduction` | 0.05 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer tokens (more efficient) |
| `errorReduction` | 0.05 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer errors |
| `toolCallReduction` | 0.025 | [-1, 1] | Positive = fewer tool calls |
| `timeReduction` | 0.025 | [-1, 1] | Positive = faster |

A `tokenReduction` of -1.0 means the skilled run used ≥2× the baseline's tokens. This is common when a skill is loaded (the skill content itself consumes tokens) but is only -0.05 in the final score, so it rarely causes failure on its own.

### Run metrics

Each of `baseline`, `skilledIsolated`, and `skilledPlugin` contains a `metrics` object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `timedOut` | Whether this run hit the timeout |
| `wallTimeMs` | Total wall-clock time |
| `taskCompleted` | Whether assertions passed |
| `tokenEstimate` | Total tokens estimated for this run. When usage events are present, computed as `inputTokens + outputTokens`; if `inputTokens` is zero but cache activity was reported, uses `cacheReadTokens + outputTokens` instead. Falls back to chars÷4 when no usage events are available. |
| `inputTokens` | Input tokens sent to the model |
| `outputTokens` | Output tokens generated by the model |
| `cacheReadTokens` | Prompt tokens served from cache |
| `cacheWriteTokens` | Prompt tokens written to cache |
| `judgeInputTokens` | Input tokens consumed by the LLM judge for this run |
| `judgeOutputTokens` | Output tokens generated by the LLM judge for this run |
| `judgeCacheReadTokens` | Judge prompt tokens served from cache |
| `judgeCacheWriteTokens` | Judge prompt tokens written to cache |
| `turnCount` | Number of agent turns |
| `toolCallCount` | Number of tool calls |
| `toolCallBreakdown` | Tool call counts by tool name |
| `errorCount` | Number of errors during the run |
| `assertionResults[]` | Per-assertion pass/fail with messages |
| `agentOutput` | The agent's final text output |

> **Tip:** To get the total input/output token cost for an eval scenario, sum the token fields across baseline and skilled runs. For example, a scenario's total input tokens are `baseline.metrics.inputTokens + skilledIsolated.metrics.inputTokens` (plus `skilledPlugin.metrics.inputTokens` if a plugin run is present). The `judge*` fields track the judging overhead separately.

> **Note:** The quality scores shown in the summary table (e.g., "4.0/5") come from `baseline.judgeResult.overallScore`, `skilledIsolated.judgeResult.overallScore`, etc. — they are on the run result object, not inside `metrics`. When parsing `results.json`, look for `judgeResult.overallScore` alongside `metrics` on each run.

### eval.yaml scenario options

Several scenario-level options in `eval.yaml` are relevant when diagnosing failures:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timeout` | Maximum wall-clock time per run in seconds. Default is 120 seconds if omitted. Increase when skilled runs time out. |
| `reject_tools` | Array of tool names that will cause the run to fail if they are used (e.g., `["bash", "edit"]`). This is enforced as a post-run assertion in the validator (it does not sandbox or block the tool calls), and is useful to force the agent to explain rather than explore/build, leveling the playing field between baseline and skilled runs. |
| `setup.files` | Array of files to create before the run. Gives the agent concrete code to work with, reducing variance from different scaffolding strategies. |

## Common failure patterns

### 1. Timeout with empty output

**Symptoms:**
- `timedOut: true`
- `agentOutput` is empty or just `\n\n`
- All assertions fail
- `toolCallBreakdown` shows `bash` usage

**Cause:** The model spent its entire time budget running shell commands (e.g., `dotnet new`, `dotnet add package`, exploring NuGet contents) and never produced user-facing text.

**Fixes:**
- **Increase `timeout`** in `eval.yaml` — 180s is often not enough for scenarios that involve code generation. Try 360s.
- **Restructure the prompt** to discourage bash exploration (e.g., "Show me the code" rather than "Create a project")
- **Add `reject_tools: ["bash"]`** if the scenario should be answerable without shell commands

### 2. Baseline already bad

**Symptoms:**
- Baseline scores are very low (1.0–2.0/5)
- Skilled scores are also low
- Quality improvement shows 0 or negative

**Cause:** The question is too hard for the model even without the skill. The skill can't fix what the model can't do.

**Fixes:**
- Simplify the scenario prompt
- Verify the baseline is working by examining `baseline.metrics.agentOutput`
- Consider whether the scenario is testing the right thing

### 3. High variance across runs

**Symptoms:**
- `perRunScores` contains both positive and negative values (e.g., `[0.07, -0.85, 0.04]`)
- A spread greater than ~0.3 between min and max scores suggests problematic variance
- Results flip between passing and failing across eval runs
- Isolated and plugin scores disagree

**Cause:** LLM non-determinism. The model takes different strategies on different runs.

**Fixes:**
- **Increase `--runs`** for more statistical stability (5 is the default; consider 7–10 for noisy scenarios)
- **Tighten the prompt** to reduce the space of valid strategies
- **Add `setup.files`** to give the model concrete files to work with rather than letting it scaffold from scratch

### 4. Quality unchanged but weighted score negative

**Symptoms:**
- Footnote says "Quality unchanged but weighted score is -X% due to: judgment, tokens, tool calls"
- The skilled output is roughly as good as baseline

**Cause:** The skill adds token overhead (the skill content itself uses tokens) but doesn't improve quality enough to offset it.

**Fixes:**
- **Improve the skill content** to produce clearly better output for this scenario
- **Reduce skill size** — shorter skills have less token overhead
- **Check if the rubric matches** what the skill actually teaches

### 5. Skill not activated

**Symptoms:**
- Skills Loaded column shows `⚠️ NOT ACTIVATED` in the legacy `skill-validator` report (the current Vally PR comment shows this as `⚠️ N/total`, e.g. `⚠️ 1/2`, when fewer scenarios activated the skill than expected)
- `skillActivationIsolated` and/or `skillActivationPlugin` fields in results.json show `activated: false` (or the legacy `skillActivation` alias)
- `detectedSkills` is empty or `skillEventCount` is 0
- The skilled run metrics look similar to baseline (the agent ran normally but without the skill's guidance)

**Cause:** The agent runtime didn't select the skill for this prompt. The skill's frontmatter `description` didn't match.

**Fixes:**
- Update the skill's `description` in SKILL.md frontmatter to better match the scenario prompt
- Make sure the description includes keywords from the scenario
- Check the scenario itself has sufficient information that the agent can reason that it needs the skill. (It should not cheat and suggest the skill.)

>   The CLI drops them from the menu entirely, freeing budget for the skills
>   that should be discoverable. (They remain invocable by explicit name.)
> - Reduce the plugin's aggregate skill-menu footprint so its model-invocable
>   skills fit under the budget. The `check` command enforces this via

>   location + markup, via `SkillProfiler.RenderedSkillMenuCost`) — not just the
>   raw description — and counting only skills *without*
>   `disable-model-invocation: true`. Counting the rendered block makes passing
>   `check` a faithful proxy for "fits in the real CLI menu budget".
> - As a last resort, consolidate overlapping skills so the plugin exposes
>   fewer model-invocable entries.

### 6. Rubric penalizes valid alternatives

**Symptoms:**
- Pairwise judge picks baseline over skill
- Both outputs are correct but use different approaches
- `pairwiseResult.rubricResults` shows the rubric criterion is too narrow

**Cause:** The rubric item favors one specific approach (e.g., step-by-step UI walkthrough) over an equally valid alternative (e.g., single CLI command).

**Fixes:**
- **Broaden the rubric** to explicitly accept multiple valid approaches
- Example: Instead of `"Shows step-by-step UI configuration"`, use `"Explains how to connect — either as a single CLI command or via the UI configuration"`

### 7. Judge regressions on close calls

**Symptoms:**
- `overallJudgmentImprovement` is -0.4 even though quality scores are similar
- Pairwise judge is inconsistent between position-swapped runs

**Cause:** When outputs are nearly equal, the judge's position bias can dominate. The position-swap mitigation defaults to "tie" on inconsistency, but the weighted scoring still penalizes.

**Fixes:**
- This is usually noise — re-run the eval to see if it persists
- If it consistently happens, improve the skill to produce clearly differentiated output

### 8. Baseline already good (no headroom)

**Symptoms:**
- Baseline scores are high (4.5–5.0/5)
- Skilled scores are similar or slightly lower
- `perRunScores` are consistently negative (e.g., `[-0.42, -0.73, -0.47]`)
- Breakdown shows negative `tokenReduction` and `toolCallReduction` (skill overhead) but no quality gain

**Cause:** The model already knows this topic well from training data. The skill can't improve on an already-excellent answer, and the overhead of loading the skill (extra tokens, tool calls) causes a net regression.

**Fixes:**
- **Add a `reject_tools` constraint** (e.g., `["bash", "edit"]`) so the eval fails if either baseline or skilled agent uses those tools — this keeps the comparison focused on answer quality instead of tool-induced overhead
- **Make the scenario harder** so the baseline struggles — add complexity, edge cases, or constraints that require the skill's specific knowledge
- **Rewrite the prompt** to be purely diagnostic (e.g., "Don't modify any files — just explain the root cause") to prevent the agent from spending time on tool calls
- **Remove the scenario** if the model consistently scores 5.0/5 without the skill — it isn't testing the skill's value

## When multiple patterns apply

Most failing scenarios match 2–3 patterns simultaneously (e.g., timeout + token overhead + high variance). Fix them in this priority order:

1. **Timeouts (#1)** — if the model can't finish, nothing else matters. Increase timeout first.
2. **Skill not activated (#5)** — if the skill never loaded, fix the description before tuning anything else.
3. **Baseline already bad (#2)** — if the baseline scores ≤2.0/5, the scenario may need simplification regardless of the skill.
4. **Baseline already good (#8)** — if the baseline scores ≥4.5/5, consider adding `reject_tools`, making the scenario harder, or removing it.
5. **High variance (#3)** — if `perRunScores` are unstable, a single eval run is unreliable. Re-run before concluding the skill is broken.
6. **Rubric/judgment issues (#6, #7)** — once the runs are stable, tune the rubric.
7. **Token overhead (#4)** — only optimize if quality is already good but the weighted score is marginally negative.

## Improving the skill vs. gaming the eval

When investigating failures, the goal is to **make the skill more useful to users** — not simply to make the eval score go up. Score improvement should be *evidence* of a better skill, not an end in itself.

### Legitimate fixes (improve the skill)

- Better skill content, structure, or examples
- Better frontmatter `description` so the skill activates on relevant prompts
- Removing a scenario where the baseline already scores perfectly (the skill genuinely adds no value)
- Adding `setup.files` so the scenario tests what was intended rather than scaffolding ability

### Illegitimate fixes (game the eval)

- Relaxing rubric criteria so both runs score higher for less
- Rewriting rubric items to match what the skill *happens* to produce rather than what a good answer *should* contain
- Softening prompt expectations to avoid exposing a real skill weakness
- Adding `reject_tools` to hide behavioral divergences between baseline and skilled runs (e.g., baseline explains while skilled run edits files — constraining tools makes the scores converge but doesn't fix the underlying issue)

### Gray area (use judgment)

- **Tightening a prompt** to reduce ambiguity is legitimate if the prompt is genuinely unclear, but illegitimate if done to steer toward the skill's strengths
- **Broadening a rubric** to accept multiple valid approaches (#6 above) is legitimate; broadening it to accept *wrong* approaches is not
- **Removing a scenario** because the baseline already aces it is an honest admission; removing it because the skill makes things worse is hiding a problem

When in doubt, ask: *"Would this change make the skill more useful to a real user, or does it just make the number go up?"*

## Analyzing results with an AI agent

The `results.json` file is designed to be machine-readable. An AI agent can:

1. **Parse the JSON** and extract metrics for each scenario
2. **Compare baseline vs skilled** metrics to identify regressions
3. **Read `agentOutput`** to see what the model actually produced
4. **Check `assertionResults`** to see which assertions failed
5. **Read `pairwiseResult.rubricResults`** for the judge's per-criterion reasoning
6. **Examine `perRunScores`** to assess variance
7. **Look at `toolCallBreakdown`** to understand what the model spent time on
8. **Cross-reference `isolatedBreakdown`** to see which metrics drove the score
9. **Review `overfittingResult`** if present — check `rubricAssessments` for items classified as `"technique"` (the rubric enforces a specific approach rather than testing an outcome). These are candidates for broadening. Also check `crossScenarioIssues` for systemic concerns about the eval design.

### Example analysis script

> **Note:** Save this as a `.py` file rather than running via `python -c "..."` — the nested quotes in f-string dictionary access are difficult to escape on the command line.

```python
import json

def analyze(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    for verdict in data['verdicts']:
        print(f"=== {verdict['skillName']} (passed={verdict['passed']}) ===")
        for scenario in verdict['scenarios']:
            name = scenario['scenarioName']
            bl_metrics = scenario['baseline']['metrics']
            sk_metrics = scenario['skilledIsolated']['metrics']
            bl_quality = scenario['baseline'].get('judgeResult', {}).get('overallScore', '?')
            sk_quality = scenario['skilledIsolated'].get('judgeResult', {}).get('overallScore', '?')
            improvement = scenario.get('improvementScore', 0)
            print(f"\n--- {name} ---")
            print(f"  Quality: baseline={bl_quality}/5, skilled={sk_quality}/5")
            print(f"  Baseline: timedOut={bl_metrics['timedOut']}, tokens={bl_metrics.get('tokenEstimate', 0)}")
            print(f"    input={bl_metrics.get('inputTokens', 0)}, output={bl_metrics.get('outputTokens', 0)}")
            print(f"  Skilled:  timedOut={sk_metrics['timedOut']}, tokens={sk_metrics.get('tokenEstimate', 0)}")
            print(f"    input={sk_metrics.get('inputTokens', 0)}, output={sk_metrics.get('outputTokens', 0)}")
            print(f"  Improvement: {improvement:.1%}")

            # perRunScores is a flat list of numbers (one per run)
            per_run = scenario.get('perRunScores', [])
            if per_run:
                formatted = ', '.join(f'{s:.2f}' for s in per_run)
                print(f"  Per-run scores: [{formatted}]")

            for a in sk_metrics.get('assertionResults', []):
                status = 'PASS' if a['passed'] else 'FAIL'
                print(f"  Assertion [{status}]: {a['message']}")

analyze('results.json')
```
