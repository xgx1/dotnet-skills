"""Eval quality gate.

Codifies structural defect classes that can corrupt an evaluation result, so
they cannot silently recur in any plugin.

FAILS on unambiguous bugs:
  1. Referenced fixture missing on disk. The scenario fails at setup, which
     reads as a skill failure.
  2. Referenced fixture not tracked by git. `.gitignore` once silently swallowed
     a Cobertura fixture: the scenarios passed locally and would have failed in
     CI.
  3. Cobertura `line-rate` contradicts its own `<lines>`. The crap-score skill
     documents both parse paths, so the two arms can read different inputs and
     the eval measures that disagreement instead of the skill.
  4. Whole-file Cobertura totals contradict the declared file rate, for lines
     (`lines-covered`/`lines-valid` vs `line-rate`) or branches
     (`branches-covered`/`branches-valid` vs `branch-rate`). Summary attributes
     are another parse path, so mismatched totals split readers on the same
     fixture.
  5. Aggregate `line-rate` contradicts the `<lines>` beneath it. File, package,
     and class rates are often the prompt-level coverage number, so disagreement
     there changes what the scenario is asking about.
  6. Grader with a missing or empty required config. The YAML parses, but the
     grader silently enforces nothing and the scenario has one fewer assertion
     than it appears to.
  7. Dormancy guard that also sets `reject_skills`. That forces the skilled arm
     skill-free, making it identical to the baseline arm, so the score is judge
     noise.
  8. Fewer than MIN_STIMULI preference-eligible distinct stimuli. Explicit
     dormancy scenarios are activation-contract evidence, not preference votes.
     The pass gate applies an exact one-sided sign test and cannot reach 5% on
     fewer than five discordant votes
     (0.5^4 = 0.0625 > 0.05 >= 0.031 = 0.5^5). Repeated runs measure the
     reliability of one task; they do not create independent task samples.
     Existing evals are grandfathered through a shrink-only allowlist.
  9. Duplicate key in a mapping. YAML keeps the last one, so a stray second
     `prompt:`/`environment:`/`graders:` block silently overwrites the scenario
     it lands in, turning it into a clone of another. Scenario counts still look
     right, which is why only the parser can catch it.
 10. A spec declaring both `config:` and `defaults:`. `config` is a deprecated
     alias for `defaults`; vally's loader throws on a spec carrying both, the
     evaluate job then produces no verdicts, and CI misreports that as a
     transient infrastructure failure.
 11. Duplicate stimulus names. Vally pairs comparison trajectories by stimulus
     name and trial index, so names are slot identity, not display text.

Every failing check above is structural — it inspects file existence, git
state, declared numbers, or YAML shape/keys — so it cannot fire spuriously on
well-written content.

REPORTS warnings for pre-existing debt and judgement calls: grandfathered
underpowered evals, orphaned fixtures, skills with no eval, and dormancy guards
that appear to lack an anti-hijack rubric item. Warnings do not fail unless
`--strict` is passed. That last one is deliberately a warning: detecting "the
rubric says the skill should stay dormant" needs phrase matching, which will
always have false positives, and a gate that blocks a PR spuriously is a gate
the team turns off.
